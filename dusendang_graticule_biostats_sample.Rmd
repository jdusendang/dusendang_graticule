## Background (from readme)

Consider a cohort study design with a defined exposure and an outcome of interest (which is not 
mortality).

- Study period from July 1st though Dec 31st 2022
- Exposure enters a subject into the exposed cohort and serves as the index date
- Exposed subjects are exact matched with unexposed subjects based on age, gender, and a healthcare 
encounter within the same week
- Matching is performed without replacement
- Exposed subjects may serve as unexposed matches during any week before the week of their exposure 
date

The provided tables (in csv format) contain the following data elements:
Patient table

- Patient ID
- Gender
- Date of birth
- Date of death | NULL

Encounter table
- Patient ID
- Encounter date
- Exposure binary indicator
- Outcome binary indicator

For each of the following analysis steps, provide working code (in a language of your choosing):

1. Load the data tables into dataframe(s) or a database
2. Compute median age at index date for the exposed cohort (including CI at 95% confidence level)
3. Compute aggregate time at risk for the exposed cohort, in person-days
4. Finally, provide pseudo-code to select a 1:1 unexposed cohort based on the method outlined above.


## Load packages
```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(misty)

```


## Load data 
```{r}

patient_raw = read.csv('patient_table.csv')
encounter_raw = read.csv('encounter_table.csv')

```


## Prep and clean 
```{r}

#are columns the right class? 
sapply(patient_raw, class)
sapply(encounter_raw, class)

#dates need to be date class and binaries need to be TRUE FALSE
patient = patient_raw %>%
  mutate(birth_date = as.Date(birthdate, format = '%Y-%m-%d'),
         death_date = as.Date(deceaseddate, format = '%Y-%m-%d'))

encounter = encounter_raw %>%
  mutate(encounter_date = as.Date(encounterdate, format = '%Y-%m-%d'),
         exposure2 = as.logical(exposure),
         outcome2 = as.logical(outcome))

```


## Prep exposed data 
```{r}

study_start_date = as.Date('2022-07-01', format = '%Y-%m-%d')
study_end_date = as.Date('2022-12-31', format = '%Y-%m-%d')

cohort = patient %>%
  #first outcome date
  left_join(encounter %>%
              filter(outcome2 == TRUE) %>%
              select(patientid, outcome_date = encounter_date) %>%
              group_by(patientid) %>%
              filter(outcome_date == min(outcome_date)) %>%
              ungroup(), by = 'patientid') %>%
  #first exposure date
  left_join(encounter %>%
              filter(exposure2 == TRUE) %>%
              select(patientid, exposure_date = encounter_date) %>%
              group_by(patientid) %>%
              filter(exposure_date == min(exposure_date)) %>%
              ungroup(), by = 'patientid') %>%
  #exclude patients who died before study start 
  filter(is.na(death_date) | death_date >= study_start_date) %>%
  #exclude patients with exposure prior to study start as we can't measure their length of follow-up
  #during the study period (index must be during the study period) 
  filter(is.na(exposure_date) | exposure_date >= study_start_date) %>%
  #exclude patients with outcome prior to study start as they aren't 'at risk'
  filter(is.na(outcome_date) | outcome_date >= study_start_date) 
  
exposed = cohort %>%
  #filter to exposed 
  filter(!is.na(exposure_date)) %>%
  #remove those with outcome prior to exposure (not 'at risk' for outcome during exposure 
  filter(is.na(outcome_date) | outcome_date >= exposure_date)

```


## Median age at index for exposed (with 95% CI)
```{r}

age_index = exposed %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(exposure_date - birth_date) / 365.25)

#median 
median = median(age_index$age)
ci_median = ci.median(age_index$age, alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = 0.95)

#print it 
print(paste('Median age at index among exposed: ', round(median), ' years (95% CI: ', 
            round(ci_median$result$low), '-', round(ci_median$result$upp), ')', sep = ''))

```


## Time at risk for exposed 
Includes all time exposed before outcome, death, or end of study 
```{r}

time_at_risk = exposed %>%
  mutate(end_of_fu = pmin(outcome_date, death_date, study_end_date, na.rm = TRUE),
         time_at_risk = as.numeric(end_of_fu - exposure_date)) 

tot_time_at_risk = sum(time_at_risk$time_at_risk)

print(paste('Total time at risk among exposed: ', tot_time_at_risk, ' person-days', sep = ''))

```


## Matching 
```{r}
